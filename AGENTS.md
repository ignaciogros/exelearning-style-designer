# AGENTS.md

Working rules for building an **eXeLearning style** with the Style Designer and an AI
coding agent. Target: **eXeLearning 4.0.4** (§2).

Read this before editing anything. It is the only place where the rules live: **the style
files ship to third parties as they are**, so they must carry no instructions, no
conventions and no rationale beyond short comments that explain the code itself.

Two audiences, one file: a human designer directing the work, and the agent doing it. If
you are the agent, everything here is binding.

---

## 1. Ground rules

| Rule | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Files you may edit | **`theme/` only** |
| Files you may never edit | `contents/` (the exported sample content), `contents/*/libs/` (the application's own JS and CSS), and everything in `files/` |
| Code comments | **English**, always, in every `.css` and `.js` |
| Comment length | **One line whenever possible.** Two or three only when a value would be a mystery without them |
| Indentation | **4 spaces**, never tabs. One declaration per line |
| Colours | Lowercase hex, three or six digits, or a `:root` variable |
| Strings in JS | Single quotes |
| Accessibility | **WCAG 2.2 level AA** (§12) |

Three more that matter in practice:

- **Prefer overriding an existing selector to inventing one.** Your stylesheet loads last
  (§9), so equal specificity already wins. A new selector is a decision — say so, and say
  why the existing one could not carry the change.
- **Ask when the design goal and the exported HTML disagree.** The HTML is fixed (§7);
  guessing produces a rule that works on one page and breaks on the next.
- **Report briefly.** The change is reviewed in the code, not in prose. State what you
  actually verified and what you did not — a measured number beats an adjective.

### Inside the editor: recognisable, and nothing more

The style is also loaded by the eXeLearning editor, and two rules govern that, in this order.

1. **The author must be able to tell what the exported page will look like.** The editor
   cannot render it identically — different wrapper, different host CSS, no export-only
   classes — and it does not have to. It has to be *recognisable*: same typeface, same
   colours, same icon treatment, same weight of a heading against its body text. A style
   that looks like a different design in the editor makes the author work blind.
2. **Touch the application's interface as little as possible. Always.** Your reach stops at
   the content area — what becomes the exported page. Toolbars, panels, dialogs, trees and
   buttons belong to the application; restyling them is out of scope even when you can.

⚠️ **A rule that exists only for the editor is the one to distrust.** It was written against
a host you probably could not see at the time, so it survives long after the reason for it
does. Before adding one, check whether the export's own rules already reach that element —
often they do, and the editor-only rule is then adding a second, conflicting decision. Before
keeping one, open the editor and look.

### What a comment is for

**Almost nothing.** A comment earns its place only as a short section label, or as the
one-line note beside an `!important` naming the inline style it fights (§9).

**When a value is not obvious, explain it on screen, not in the file.** One brief line in
your reply — the ratio you landed on, the surface you measured against, why this value and
not the neighbouring one — and nothing in the stylesheet. Whoever receives the shipped
style gets the rule; whoever is directing the work gets the reasoning, while they are still
directing it.

```css
/* Bad: explains what the reader can already see, and tells a story */
/* Links the author writes into the footer. They used to take --exe-ink, the heading
   color, so they read as bold text rather than as links, and no hover rule could
   reach them: an id beats .exe-content a:hover, so the color never moved. */
```

Design rationale, decisions and history go in your own working notes, **outside the
style** — and, if the notes are about one specific style rather than about styles in
general, outside this repository too.

---

## 2. The workspace

The Style Designer is a local previewer. It takes three exports of the same eXeLearning
project and wires them all to a single editable copy of the style.

```
theme/           <- THE STYLE. Everything you edit is here
contents/web/    <- Website export        preview target
contents/page/   <- Single page export    preview target
contents/scorm/  <- SCORM 1.2 export      preview target
```

Both folders are recreated from scratch on every upload and are **not** part of the
repository.

⚠️ **The exports must come from eXeLearning 4.0.4.** Earlier versions are not supported, and
the failure is silent rather than loud: the markup you are styling against simply lacks
things 4.0.4 has — `--exe-fx-focus-color` read by the effects components (§11), the
teacher-mode switch (§8), General Icons as Material Symbols, and `$exeExport.setUrlParam`
(§9). A style verified against an older export can look finished and still be wrong. If a
check below reports a component as absent, confirm the export's version before concluding
the style does not need to handle it.

### Getting a workspace

`index.php` → **Start** → either upload three exports named `*_web.zip`, `*_page.zip`,
`*_scorm.zip` (the names eXeLearning gives them — do not rename), or click **Use sample
contents** to load the bundled fixtures.

If you upload your own project, **turn every export preference on** (page counter, search
box, and so on) and include every box variant you can — with and without icon, with and
without title, with and without the minimise button. The optional elements in §7 are
exactly what a style breaks on, and you cannot test what you did not export.

### Previewing

The three buttons at the top of `index.php` swap one iframe between the formats. For
iterating on a single page it is faster to open it directly:

```
contents/web/html/<page>.html
contents/page/index.html
contents/scorm/html/<page>.html
```

The sample content ships pages built to exercise specific cases — box variants, message
blocks, the interactive effects, a highlighted menu link. Prefer them to invented markup.

### Finishing

**Finish / Restart** → edit `theme/config.xml` → **Download Style** → import the `.zip`
into eXeLearning. Same screen deletes everything and starts over.

---

## 3. ⚠️ Path resolution: there are three mechanisms, and they do not agree

**This is the single thing to internalise about the workspace.** The exported HTML loads
`../../../theme/style.css`, so **the CSS and the JS at the root are the ones in force**.
Images are not so simple:

| Referenced from | Resolves in |
| --- | --- |
| `url()` inside `theme/style.css` — sprites, background images | **`theme/img/`** (root). Visible immediately |
| `src` written by `theme/style.js` — anything the script injects | **`contents/*/theme/img/`** (each export's own copy) |
| `src` in the exported HTML — iDevice icons | **`contents/*/theme/icons/`** (each export's own copy) |

So: edit a background image and the preview updates. Edit an image that the script or the
HTML points at, and **you must copy it to all three `contents/*/theme/` folders** or you
will be looking at the old one and debugging the wrong thing.

None of this affects the downloaded `.zip`, which is built from `theme/` alone. It is a
preview artefact only.

---

## 4. ⚠️ Cache

The exported HTML adds `?v=` to **`style.css` and `style.js` only**. The HTML itself, the
images referenced from CSS, and the application's stylesheets get no cache buster.

**Hard reload (`Ctrl+Shift+R`) after editing anything other than those two files**, or you
will diagnose a file the browser never loaded. This produces false conclusions that look
exactly like real bugs: a sprite that "did not change", an application stylesheet whose
edit "had no effect".

---

## 5. ⚠️ `file://` is not the same as being served

Exports are frequently opened straight from disk. A browser treats a local file as an
**opaque origin**, which discards anything that needs a CORS check.

- **`mask-image` does not work over `file://`.** An icon painted with a sprite mask simply
  disappears. Use `background-image`, which has no such restriction.
- `background-image`, `<img>` and local `@font-face` are fine.
- Rule of thumb: if something is visible when served but not from disk, suspect CORS
  before suspecting the CSS.

---

## 6. What a style package is

```
<style-name>/
  config.xml        required
  style.css         required
  style.js          optional
  screenshot.png    required, 1200x550 recommended
  icons/            required, iDevice icons
  img/              optional; favicon.png or favicon.ico here replaces the default
  fonts/            optional, .woff2
```

- **Several `.css` or `.js` files are allowed. They load in alphabetical order.**
- The distributable is a `.zip` named after `<name>` in `config.xml`, **with no wrapping
  parent folder**. The Finish screen builds it for you.
- `config.xml` fields: `name` (folder id, no spaces or special characters), `title`,
  `version`, `compatibility`, `author`, `license`, `license-url`, `description`.
- `description` is the only place the end user ever sees third-party credits. **Every
  font, icon set and image that is not yours goes there, with its licence.** Trademarks
  and logos that are not covered by the style's own licence must say so explicitly, and
  should be removable — a setting in `style.js` that drops the element is the usual way.

If a style is derived from another one, its licence terms come along with it.

---

## 7. Export formats

Every export carries `exe-export` on `<body>` plus one format class:

| Format | Body class |
| --- | --- |
| Website | `exe-web-site` |
| Single page | `exe-single-page` |
| SCORM | `exe-scorm` (plus a version class such as `exe-scorm12`) |
| IMS | `exe-ims` |
| EPUB | `exe-epub` / `exe-epub3` |

**Design for the default first, then override for the format that differs.** The website
is almost always the exception: it is the only format with a top bar, a navigation menu
and a logo band, so anything positioned there is the special case, not the baseline.

What each format is really used for, and what it changes:

- **Website** — fully standalone, owns the whole page. The only format where a
  reader-facing control such as a dark mode toggle makes unambiguous sense.
- **Single page** — the whole project in one file, commonly used for printing. Check
  `@media print`.
- **SCORM / IMS** — displayed inside an LMS **iframe**. The host decides the surrounding
  appearance and usually brings its own dark mode. `localStorage` is third-party storage
  there: Safari blocks it and Chrome partitions it or throws when third-party cookies are
  off, so anything that depends on it appears for some students and not others. **An
  intermittent control is worse than no control** — prefer to disable the feature in this
  format rather than let the browser decide.
- **EPUB** — the reader controls a lot. Some application JS deliberately skips EPUB.

`<html>` carries `id="exe-index"` on the index page and `id="exe-<node-id>"` elsewhere.
Useful to target the home page, and the reason relative paths differ by one level between
the index and the rest.

---

## 8. The HTML you do not control

Three different origins, and the difference matters:

1. **Generated by the application** — page header, navigation, footer, boxes. Fixed
   structure, never edit it.
2. **Written by the author** — everything inside the content area. Arbitrary and
   unbounded: any heading level, tables, images, lists, embedded media.
3. **Injected at runtime by the application's JavaScript** — see §9.

`.exe-content` wraps all exported content and exists to keep the style from leaking into
the eXeLearning editor interface. **Scope content rules to it.**

### Elements that may or may not be there

This is the single most common source of broken styles. Never assume any of these exists:

| Element | Missing when |
| --- | --- |
| `.package-subtitle` | The author left the subtitle empty |
| `.page-counter` | Page numbering disabled in the export preferences |
| `#teacher-mode-toggler-wrapper` | The project has no `.teacher-only` content. Injected by the app, not present in the HTML |
| `#packageLicense` | No licence chosen. Its class also carries **which** licence (`cc-by-sa`, `cc-0`…) |
| `#siteUserFooter` | Empty, or filled with arbitrary author HTML **including links** |
| `.box-toggle` | The iDevice is not collapsible |
| `.box-icon` | The iDevice has no icon; the header then carries `.no-icon` |
| `.box.no-header` | No title, no icon and no toggle at all |
| `#siteNav`, `.nav-buttons`, `#siteLogos` | Every format except the website |
| `.exe-attachment-link`, `.exe-fx`, `.exe-dl`, `.exe-block-*` | Only if the author used them |

Two consequences worth stating:

- **A style must look finished with the minimum and with the maximum.** Test a box with
  title, icon and toggle, and a box with none of them.
- **Optional does not mean rare.** Author-written footer links, for instance, need a link
  colour that works on the footer surface, not on the page background.

### Author content is not white

Contrast has to be checked **against the surface the element actually sits on**, not
against the page. A link colour verified at 4.6:1 on white can fall under AA on a tinted
panel. Every tinted surface in the style is a place to re-check.

---

## 9. The application's JavaScript, and how it reaches into your CSS

The exported page runs jQuery plus the application's own scripts
(`contents/*/libs/`). Read them before assuming a structure — they are the specification
for anything you cannot see in the HTML.

### It reads colours out of your CSS and writes them back inline

Some components take their colour from the computed `color` of their container and then
write it into a `style=` attribute:

```js
var mainColor = $exeFX.timeline.getColor(e);   // the CSS color of .exe-timeline
var bg = $(e).css('color');                    // the CSS color of dl.exe-dl
```

**These are doors, not obstacles: set `color` on the container and the component
follows.** No `!important` needed. But the value is inherited by everything inside, so
**the prose within the component has to be given its colour back** — otherwise the body
text of a timeline event comes out in the accent colour.

Other components write inline styles you did not ask for — a container shadow tinted with
a child's background, a border colour taken from the container's own background (which
erases hairlines when the container is white). Those can only be contradicted with
`!important`. **Every `!important` must have a one-line comment naming the inline style it
is fighting.** If it has no such comment, it should not exist.

### It injects markup after load

Togglers, pagination, accordion sections, definition-list chips, and more. Consequences:

- The DOM you style is not the DOM in the file.
- Anything the JS builds is absent when JS is off. The page must still be readable.
- The application also adds `js` / `post-js` classes and `mode-teacher` on `<html>`.
  Teacher mode can also be forced with `?exe-teacher=1`.

### Useful globals

`$exe_i18n` holds the interface strings — `menu`, `search`, `more`, `mode_toggler`,
`teacher_mode`, `hide`, `download`, `block`, `toggleContent`. **Never hardcode interface
text: the export is translated.**

`$exeExport.setUrlParam(href, name, value)` sets one query parameter on an href, keeping
every other parameter and the fragment; pass `null` as the value to remove it. It is
defined in `libs/exe_export.js`, which every format loads.

**Use it for any URL a style rewrites — never split the string yourself.** A style that
carries its own state across navigation (`nav=false` for a collapsed menu is the usual
one) has to add and remove a parameter on links the application generated, and the
hand-rolled versions of that are wrong in ways that do not show up in a quick test:

```js
e.href = ref.split('?')[0];             // drops EVERY parameter, and the fragment with it
e.href = ref + '?' + 'nav=false';       // a second '?' if the link already had a query
window.location = this.href + '?nav=false';  // lands INSIDE the fragment if there is a #ancla
```

Through those URLs travel `exe-teacher`, `q`, `print` and the four xAPI credentials, so
wiping the query **breaks LMS tracking and teacher mode**, and the exported links already
arrive with parameters the application put there. Read the current value with
`URLSearchParams`, not by searching the string:

```js
if (new URLSearchParams(window.location.search).get('nav') === 'false') { … }
```

Operate on `getAttribute('href')`, not on the `.href` property: the property absolutises
the relative links the export writes.

### If your own `style.js` runs at parse time

A script that must set a class on `<html>` before first paint (a stored theme choice, for
instance) runs while the head is still being parsed. At that moment **`<body>` does not
exist**, so the format classes of §7 cannot be read, and `localStorage.getItem` **throws**
in a sandboxed iframe or with cookies blocked — an unguarded call kills the rest of the
file and the page loses its menu, its breadcrumbs and everything else the script builds.

Guard the access, and let `init()` undo the class where the feature does not apply. The
parse-time call and `init()` have to stay in sync: change one, revisit the other.

---

## 10. Specificity, load order and the base stylesheets

The exported page loads, in this order:

```
bootstrap.min.css → idevice css → exe_effects.css → exe_atools.css → base.css → your style.css
```

Your stylesheet is last, so **equal specificity is enough to win** — no `!important` for
ordinary overrides.

Three traps that follow:

- **`base.css` beats `exe_effects.css`.** Rules in the effects stylesheet written with one
  class lose to `base.css` rules of the same specificity that come later. If a component
  looks wrong out of the box, check the cascade before blaming the component.
- **An `id` beats any class combination.** A rule like `#siteFooter a` cannot be overridden
  by `.exe-content a:hover`, so hover states silently never apply. When a selector uses an
  id, its states must be written with the same id.
- **Two of your own rules at equal specificity: the later one wins entirely, not
  per-value.** Where a single property carries two meanings at once — two markers packed
  into one `box-shadow`, say — a combined selector that declares both is the only fix.

`base.css` also claims `:hover` and `:focus` on content links at low specificity. When you
recolour a link, **list its states explicitly** or `base.css` keeps them.

---

## 11. Images

Everything in §3 applies to where they live. Two more things decide whether they work.

**Sprites are positioned in pixels.** A sprite is addressed with
`background-position: -Npx` at several `background-size` scales at once. **The cell grid
is a contract**: re-export at a different cell size and every icon in the style moves.
Fix the grid first, then draw.

**Flat ink and transparent backgrounds survive filters; nothing else does.** Icons drawn
as a single flat colour on transparency respond predictably to `filter`, so a dark mode,
a hover brightness or a recolour costs one rule instead of one patch per file. Gradients,
soft shadows and semi-transparency make every subsequent adjustment a special case.

**A `<img>` and a `background-image` are not equivalent under a filter.** A background
image is part of the element and takes every filter its ancestors carry; an `<img>` can be
targeted on its own. Choose deliberately when a filter is in play — and remember §5:
`mask-image` is not an option if the export may be opened from disk.

Deliver icons at 3× the size they are displayed at, and check the displayed size, not the
file.

---

## 12. Dark mode

Two implementations, and the choice is structural — make it early.

**Filter-based** — `filter: invert(…) hue-rotate(180deg)` on `html`, re-inverting specific
elements. Cheap to add, and it is a trap worth understanding before you accept it:

- **The round trip is not a mathematical identity.** `hue-rotate` pushes saturated colours
  out of gamut and the clipping is irreversible. Images, including author photographs and
  any logo, shift colour, and a precompensated file is impossible when the required source
  channel falls outside sRGB. Verify with numbers, not by eye.
- **Two regimes coexist, and confusing them is the easy mistake.** Outside a re-inverted
  element, **write the source colour**; the reader sees the filtered one. Inside a
  re-inverted element the two filters nearly cancel, so **write the colour you want to
  see**.
- **Light hairlines are the usual casualty.** A pale border comes back nearly black and an
  outlined control loses its outline entirely — often falling under the 3:1 that WCAG
  1.4.11 requires for a control's boundary. Check every border and every icon.
- **A `filter` applies to the element's whole subtree.** It cannot tone down a background
  without draining the text and icons with it, and a `grayscale()` on a parent cannot be
  undone by a child. Where you reach for a filter to calm one thing down, a literal colour
  on that one thing is usually the real fix.
- **Do not rely on `popover`/top-layer to escape an ancestor filter.** Chrome and Firefox
  disagree, and the difference is not feature-detectable from JS.

**Variable-based** — reassign the `:root` palette inside a `html.dark-mode` block. More
work up front, exact in every browser, leaves images alone, and it is the only one that
extends cleanly to `prefers-color-scheme`. **Prefer it for a new style.**

Either way, remember the toggle's stored preference is per origin: everything served from
`localhost` shares it. If a preview comes up dark unasked, clear the key rather than
hunting for a CSS bug.

---

## 13. Accessibility

Target: **WCAG 2.2 level AA**. Non-negotiable, and the reason several palette decisions
end up looking odd.

| What | Minimum |
| --- | --- |
| Body text and links | 4.5:1 against the surface behind them |
| Large text (≥ 24px, or ≥ 19px bold) | 3:1 |
| Icons, borders, focus rings, any non-text graphic that conveys meaning | 3:1 (1.4.11) |

Rules that follow, all of them learned the hard way:

- **Check against the real surface**, never against white by default. A colour that clears
  AA on `#ffffff` by a small margin will not clear it on a tinted panel, and tinted panels
  are everywhere: boxes, footer, message blocks.
- **Focus must be visible and must survive.** Removing an underline often removes the only
  focus indicator a control had, and the application's own stylesheets set `outline: none`
  in several places. If you remove one, add a real ring:
  `outline: 2px solid <accent>; outline-offset: 2px`, on `:focus-visible` so it does not
  appear on mouse clicks. A text underline alone does not satisfy 2.4.11. **`currentColor`
  is not safe for a ring**: on a filled control the text is often white, and a white ring
  on a white page is no ring.
- **Underlines are required where a link sits among prose** (1.4.1) and not required for
  standalone controls in a bar of their own, such as pagination chips.
- **Do not let colour be the only signal.** A 3px rule plus an icon is fine; a hue alone is
  not. Reusing one gesture — the same rule, the same chip — for "this is marked" keeps a
  style from reading as several unrelated components.
- **Disabled controls are exempt from contrast, not from being perceivable.**
  `opacity: .3` is not a good default.
- Keep the link colour consistent across contexts so a link is recognisable as one
  everywhere.

### Two layout traps with accessibility consequences

- **A float does not push the following block aside.** An element with `float: right`
  leaves the flow, but a following in-flow block still spans the full width underneath it,
  and in-flow content is hit-tested **above** floats. A `padding-right` on the block only
  shortens its line of text; the box still covers the float and swallows every click on
  it. Fix by positioning the floated element — measured in Chrome, `position: relative`
  **alone is not enough**, an explicit `z-index` is required. Give interactive controls a
  `z-index` above any decorative absolutely positioned neighbour: a switch must never lose
  a click to a line of text.
- **The best fix is often not a new colour.** Before adding one, check whether the problem
  is chroma rather than luminance. A callout that "shouts" may already be closer to white
  than its replacement; what shouts is saturation.

## 14. Before calling a change done

1. **All three formats**, not just the one you were looking at.
2. **Light and dark**, if the style has a dark mode.
3. **Both extremes of the optional elements** from §8.
4. **Narrow widths**, and `@media print` for the single page.
5. **Hard reload** (§4) — otherwise the check is worthless.
6. **Contrast measured, not eyeballed**, for anything whose colour changed.
7. **Served and from `file://`**, if anything touched images or masks.
8. **With JavaScript off**, if anything depended on injected markup.
9. Confirm the style does not leak into the eXeLearning editor interface — import the zip
   and look at the application, not only at the export.

State what you verified and what you did not.
